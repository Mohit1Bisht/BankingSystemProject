# Simple Banking System

A C implementation of a basic banking system for a Data Structures and Algorithms course project. This system demonstrates the application of fundamental data structures and algorithms concepts in a practical application.

## Features

- **Account Management**
  - Create new bank accounts
  - View account details
  - List all active accounts

- **Transaction Operations**
  - Deposit funds
  - Withdraw funds
  - Transfer between accounts

- **Transaction History**
  - Track all transactions
  - View transaction history by account

- **Data Persistence**
  - Save account data to files
  - Load existing data on startup

## Data Structures Used

- Arrays to store account and transaction records
- Structures for organizing related data
- Simple queue mechanism for transaction logging

## Technical Implementation

The system is implemented in C and makes use of the following concepts:
- Array operations and management
- Struct implementation
- File I/O operations
- Basic search algorithms
- Input validation

## How to Compile and Run

```bash
# Compile the program
gcc banking_system.c -o banking_system

# Run the program
./banking_system
```

## Project Structure

- `banking_system.c` - Main source code file
- `accounts.dat` - Binary file storing account data
- `transactions.dat` - Binary file storing transaction history
